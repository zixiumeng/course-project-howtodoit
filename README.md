HowTodoit - a simple to do list app written in java

HowTodoit is a to-do list app written in java. The user will be able to interact with a virtual task manager (via command line) that is able to load data from and save data into local history (using Javaâ€™s Serializable interface).

The app right now is only a skeleton app with a CLI. The final app will be built using gradle to a JAR file and run under JRE. We will add a GUI (and more features) in later phases of the project if time allows.
